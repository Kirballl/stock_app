# Stock trading application

![Logo](stock_logo.io.png)

## 📊 Overview

This is a simple stock exchange application with a client-server architecture with authentication. The exchange trades USD for RUB, matching buy and sell orders from multiple clients.

##  📈 Features

- **Multi-client support**: The server handles multiple client connections simultaneously.
- **Order placement**: Clients can place buy or sell orders for USD/RUB.
- **Balance checking**: Clients can view their current balance.
- **Automatic order matching**: The server automatically matches orders when prices intersect.
- **Partial order execution**: Orders can be partially filled.
- **Real-time trading**: Orders are active until fully executed.
- **Unlimited balance**: Clients can trade with negative balances.
- **Active order viewing**: Clients can see their current active orders.
- **Trade history**: View completed trades.
- **Quote history**: Access historical price quotes.
- **Order cancellation**: Ability to cancel active orders.
- **Database integration**: PostgreSQL used for storing order and trade history.
- **Secure authentication**: Client authentication with password protection.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- CMake (version 3.21 or higher)
- C++17 compatible compiler
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Boost (version 1.40 or higher)
- Protobuf
- PostgreSQL client libraries
- GTest

## 🔧 Building the Project

### 📎 Initialize and update submodules
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 💼 Create dir and build all
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. --target all
```

### 🚀 Run database
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```
### 🚀 Run server
```bash
./build/server/server
```

### 🚀 Run client
```bash
./build/client/client
```

### 🧪 Run tests
```bash
./build/tests/trade_tests
```
## 🖥 Usage Instructions

After launching the client application, you will be presented with the following options:

### Authentication Menu:
1. **Sign up**: Create a new account
2. **Sign in**: Log into an existing account
3. **Exit**: Close the application

### Main Menu:
1. **Make order**: Place a new buy or sell order
   - Choose order type (buy/sell)
   - Enter USD cost in RUB
   - Enter USD amount
2. **View my balance**: Check your current account balance
3. **View all active orders**: Display all your active orders
4. **View last completed trades**: Show recent completed trades
5. **View quote history**: Display historical price quotes
6. **Cancel active order**: Cancel an existing order
   - Choose order type (buy/sell)
   - Enter the order ID you wish to cancel
7. **Exit**: Log out and close the application

### Tips:
- When entering numeric values, follow the prompts for valid ranges.
- For cancelling orders, you may want to view active orders first to get the correct order ID.

## 🏗 Project Architecture

The Stock Trading Application is built with a client-server architecture:

### Client Side:
- `client.cpp/hpp`: Handles client-side logic and communication with the server.
- `user_interface.cpp/hpp`: Manages the console-based user interface.

### Server Side:
- `auth.cpp/hpp`: generate and verify jwt.
- `client_data_manager.cpp/hpp`: Manages in-memory client data and orders info.
  - Handles client account balances and order history in RAM during server runtime
  - Loads data from database on server startup and persists to database on shutdown
  - Processes active, completed, and cancelled orders
  - Provides interfaces for updating client data and order status
  - Ensures high-performance data access and manipulation during server operation
- `core.cpp/hpp`: Core business logic for order matching and trade execution.
- `database.cpp/hpp`: Database interactions.
- `order_queue.cpp/hpp`: Wrapper over concurrentqueue.h.
- `server.cpp/hpp`: Server logic.
- `session_client_connection.cpp/hpp`: Managing a certain client connection.
- `session_manager.cpp/hpp`: Manages client sessions and orchestrates communication between server components.
  - Handles client connections and disconnections
  - Initializes and manages core server components
  - Coordinates client data and maintains session state
  - Controls server lifecycle and ensures thread-safe operations
- `time_order_utils.cpp/hpp`: Generate order id and get current timestamp.

### Common Components:
- `proto/trade_market_protocol.proto`: Defines the protocol buffer messages for client-server communication.
- `config/`: Contains configuration files for the server, database and jwt.
- `common/`: Shared utilities and definitions.

### Third-patry:
- `bcrypt` : A library to hash passwords.
- `jwt-cpp`: A library for creating and validating JSON Web Tokens.
- `moodycamel::concurrentqueue` : An industrial-strength lock-free queue.
- `jwt-cpp`: A fast logging library.

### Testing:
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for core components.

The application uses Protocol Buffers for serialization, PostgreSQL for data storage, and CMake for build management.
